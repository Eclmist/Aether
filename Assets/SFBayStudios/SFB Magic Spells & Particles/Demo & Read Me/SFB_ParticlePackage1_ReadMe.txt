Particle Package 1

Thank you for your support, I really hope you enjoy using these particles and magic spells.  I also hope you like how I've set up the package, and find it easy to use and modify to your purposes.

There are four folders:

TEXTURES:  These are the raw textures, you likely won't need to change anything here unless you want to force them to be smaller sizes.  Most are 256x256, some are larger, some are smaller.

PARTICLE COMPONENTS:  These are mostly individual particle objects.  Generally "magic spell" or what not will contain a few different particle objects together.  Use these to add to ones already created or to create your own entirely new particles and magic spells.

PARTICLES:  We've created a bunch of particles for you, ready to be used in a game.  None of these have any lighting attached.

MAGIC SPELLS:  These are particle systems ready to use in game with lighting attached.  Lights can be deselected if desired, or adjusted.  You'll find some scripts attached to the lighting as well to help with turning them on/off at the right times.

You may find it helpful to adjust some of the particle parameters.  The "Color over Time", "Size over Time", "Velocity over Time" and "Emissions" sections are likely most popular/important.  Some of the particle components in our "Magic Spells" have been modified from their original settings.

Not all of the textures are being used.
